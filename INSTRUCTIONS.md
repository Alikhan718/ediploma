## Process of NFT Diploma generation from A to Z:
1. Two new folders created on Pinata (app.pinata.cloud). One for images, another for json files. Links for those two folders then need to be pasted into "generator" script as an input
2. Excel file needs to be formatted correctly according to the template
3. "Generator" script takes links to pinata folders, diploma template and .xlsx document as an input and turns them into two files:
	1. JPEG formatted picture of the diploma 		with all necessary data in it
	2. JSON document that has all necessary 		data for NFT: name, external link, traits 	etc.
4. All generated jpeg and json files need to be pasted into folders in pinata (IPFS) so they are stored there
5. Smart-contract template should be edited by adding all the links to the IPFS and names, keeping the format that is asked by each university and maintain security and transparency
6. Smart-contract needs to be uploaded to the Ethereum blockchain and verified (Check Etherscan)
7. Check NFT Diplomas if they appeared on Marketplaces
